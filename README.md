## python basics
Write a program that prints the integers from   1   to   100   (inclusive).

  please use a class if possible.
  for multiples of three,   print   Fizz     (instead of the number)
  for multiples of five,   print   Buzz     (instead of the number)
  for multiples of both three and five,   print   FizzBuzz     (instead of the number)
